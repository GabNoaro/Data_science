As a huge Kobe fan for me is an honour perfoming explorative data analysis on this dataset.
This analysis aims to explore the main characteristics of the dataset, clean the data, identify the key target features and normalize them.
Moreover, toward the end, we will formulate an hypothesis to see if there are key differences between the Kobe that used to wear the number 8,
and the Kobe that use to wear the number 24 in influencing the target feature point_difference (point difference between the two teams at the end of a game).
This feature not only indicates if the Lakers won that game, but also of how much, and together with other correlated features,
it is a great way of solving one of the biggest debates in the NBA history: which Kobe was the strongest?
